# Reducing-Gun-Deaths

## Background and Objective

The world is a dangerous place. In recent years there has been a lot of discussion about gun deaths. Referencing FiveThirtyEight.com's report on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/), I have created several visualizations to address some questions. I used a clean version of their data posted to their GitHub repo called [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).

FiveThirtyEightâ€™s visualizations focused on yearly averages. I decided to create visualizations to answer the following questions:
- What is the relationship between intent and time of year? Specifically, is there a relationship between suicides and seasonal depression?
- What is the relationship between death count and race? Specifically, deaths caused by the police?
